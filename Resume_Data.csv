Full Stack Engineer - Settle Inc
- Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Matthew-Padich/e80a0541884c7184
I am a web developer working towards becoming a qualified full stack engineer. I am very familiar with JS, modern HTML5 / CSS3 standards and frameworks, PHP, WordPress, and all the build tools required in order to create modern SPA's and great looking static web pages. Lately I have been working on a variety of projects, most notably I have built a .NET application from the ground up for a startup and I have worked on functional programming concepts with a personal web project written in Elm. I am very interested in functional programming and learning about new technologies that will shape the future of the web.
WORK EXPERIENCE
Full Stack Engineer
Settle Inc - April 2017 to Present
Currently the sole engineer building out a peer to peer payment application via the Dwolla API. Set up back and front end build, continuous integration with Azure web services, designed our internal APIs, continue to style and maintain brand image for our application which is currently in beta.  Built on .NETCore1.1, C# 7.0, Visual Studio dev tools for Mac. Deployed for beta testing to Azure.  Handle everything from performance and DB maintenance to front end architecture. I field questions and concern for copy, design, and tech on a daily basis.
Web Developer
Elite Daily - July 2015 to April 2017
Handled all things front-end and WordPress related on the dotcom. Ads and Analytics (Google AdWords, DFP, Google Analytics), Newsletters (integration with MailChimp API), site performance (conditional script loading, prefetch, mobile optimized code, reduced TTFP ~70% in coordination with our backend team), creating new templates and styles for internal campaigns and one off pages, and created CMS tools to allow for custom content on the site.  Helped build an internal analytics tool that incorporated share / social data from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube APIs. Built the front end of the app in React.js sitting on top of SlimPHP. Helped ads and editorial to see how content was performing and how we could improve our user reach and interaction.  Contributed to the Elite Daily iOS app. Helped write unit tests, maintain code readability, and build out web views that interacted with our internal content API's.
Web Developer
Fortune.com - September 2014 to July 2015
Set up the front-end build for the site, configured tools for running unit and end to end tests, modularized our Marionette.js codebase, and optimized our CSS and JS footprint.  Built the Fortune 500 application from the ground up with one other senior JS developer. Integrated interactive ads, graphs (d3.js), and other branded content across the SPA. Learned the do's and (mostly) don'ts of structuring large scale production ready and mobile friendly MVC applications.

While working for ION, I had the opportunity to troubleshoot and correct problems reported to development (3 rd level support) as well as to implement new features (refer to PROGRAMING PROJECTS section).
Skills Mastered: � Troubleshooting: I have successfully troubleshot and corrected more than 40 issues by writing code in several modules spanning several subsystems, following strict development and release procedures instituted by the company. � Requirement Analysis & Product Development: I have participated in six in-house projects, developing new system features acting independently as the sole designer and developer in five of them. Thus, I have been exposed in all the phases of the development process, interacting with all participating parties, adhering to the company's strict formal development procedures. � Integration: I had the opportunity to integrate four features into the system, involving the modification of up to five subsystems at a time, writing test cases, and testing interfaces. � Communication: As part of the in-house projects, I successfully interacted and collaborated with the product owners, pre- sales engineers, analyzing and finalizing all system requirements. This process involved communicating with code owners of several subsystems, as well as creating and delivering presentations demonstrating the application features to higher management agents.

Responsibilities: � Worked on integration with PayPal to achieve PCI certification. � Worked on multiple enhancements to streamline the internal accounting processes. � Worked on reports. � Development was done in an Agile SDLC process with 3 week release cycle.
Project: Dataloader � This is a software component of the Tk20's campustools application written in Java that loads the data from various sources into the application database so that the campustools application can be integrated with the other softwares used by the universities to collect/generate data, example: Blackboard, Moodle. Responsibilities: � Designed and implemented a solution to make this component more generic so that it can intelligently handle different types of files and different table structures without any manual changes to the code. � Designed and implemented an automated solution with email notifications so that no manual intervention is

needed in the entire process, this resulted in a huge improvement in the turnaround time between the time customer provides the data files and the time when the customer sees the data on UI. � Designed a solution to improve the performance of this component by replacing the middleware that used Hibernate to fetch objects from database to pure JDBC and SQL statements. Implemented the POC for same and collaborated with the offshore team in India to implement the solution. This solution resulted in around 600-700% improvement in file loading speed.
Project: Onsite: � This is an offline browser app that lets user perform certain workflows in the campustools application in an offline mode and later synch the generated data with the campustools application. Responsibilities: � Worked on researching the solutions, determining the architecture and the customer delivery model for this App. Created a POC using REST API using Java's Jersey-Jackson library, Postgres, AngularJS, browser's local storage for storing data. � Collaborated with offshore team in India to implement various requirements for this product from scratch.
Project: Dashboard � The idea to create this Application was to streamline the process of deploying a build on new customer server/migrating the existing build to a new build and streamline the communication between various actors like product owners, implementation team and the systems team by enabling product owners to schedule build upgrades/installations on customer servers easily through UI instead of creating tickets and as per the schedule the app should install/update the builds on the concerned servers without manual interventions. Responsibilities: � Designed and implemented this App using React-Redux on frontend, Postgres as database, REST API to communicate with the database and Ansible to write deployment/migration playbooks. � Also designed and implemented a centralised querying solution such that a query can be run across multiple servers and results displayed in a tabular form on UI. � Integrated this App with VCentre to access server information required by Ansible playbooks.
Project: File Storage � The purpose of this project was to seamlessly store the files uploaded via the campustools application to cloud storage once the local server runs out of space for file storage. Responsibilities: � Researched into the solution and decided to use AWS s3, implemented a POC such that the file upload location is changed to s3 upon reaching the dedicated diskspace limit and then the oncoming files are automatically pushed to s3. � Integrated the solution implemented in the POC in the campustools App and modified all the file related workflows such that all the file uploads and file access actions go through a common centralised code. � This centralised code makes a decision as to where to upload or access the requested file from either s3 or local server storage.
Software Engineer, R&D
Enformia - Davidson, NC - September 2013 to March 2014
Project: Enformia tool � This is a tool that gathers biological data of subjects including medical conditions and physical activity and analyses the data to find patterns to draw a correlation between physical activity and medical conditions. Responsibilities:

� Designed and implemented a component that parses and analyses the physical activity data contained in XML files and filters out bad data generated as part of false activity, this data is then displayed on the UI in form of interactive graphs. � Implemented a solution to find physical activity patterns for each subject in the study and displayed these patterns on UI using HighCharts for comparative study.
